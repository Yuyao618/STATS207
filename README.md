# Abstract 
This report examines the impact of class size on the mathematical performance of 1st-grade students, drawing from data in Project STAR (Tennessee’s Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio). We first establish that students’ math performance is strongly correlated with class size, and then explore the analysis further, demonstrating that students in smaller classes outperform those in regular-sized classes, regardless of whether an aide is present. We anticipate that our findings will serve as a valuable contribution to the literature on how class size influences the learning environment in primary schools.
